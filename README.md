##### The objective is to gather as many watches as possible to keep the score timer above 0.
##### Once the timer is 0, the sun starts to move up and once it reaches the very top, the game will be a loss.

###### The Java language along with the LibGDX framework library with the Box2D extension was used to make this game. 
###### The code was compiled and tested using Android Studio.

###### Assets with the exception of the music, sound effects, and menu/interactive buttons were all made by me.

###### The design was done using the "screen" interaface provided by the LibGDX library which was composed of
###### implementing the following functions: show(), render(float delta), public resize(int width, int height), pause(),
###### resume(), hide(), and dispose().

###### I followed the design of initializing an object once, and recycling and reseting the values of that object using
###### show(), which is called everytime the class implemented with the "screen" interface is accessed.

##### The objective is to gather as many watches as possible to keep the score timer above 0.
##### Once the timer is 0, the sun starts to move up and once it reaches the very top, the game will be a loss.
#####    
#####   
###### The Java language along with the LibGdx framework library with the Box2D extension was used to make this game. 
###### The code was compiled and tested using Android Studio.
######    
######     
###### The rendering design was done using the "screen" interaface provided by the LibGdx library which was composed of
###### implementing the following functions: show(), render(float delta), public resize(int width, int height), pause(),
###### resume(), hide(), and dispose().
